<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>As far back into boyhood as the writer's memory may
intelligently go, the "country poet" is most pleasantly
recalled. He was, and is, as common as the "country
fiddler," and as full of good old-fashioned music. Not
a master of melody, indeed, but a poet, certainly&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Who, through long days of labor,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And nights devoid of ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still heard in his soul the music<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of wonderful melodies."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And it is simply the purpose of this series of dialectic
studies to reflect the real worth of this homely child of
nature, and to echo faithfully, if possible, the faltering
music of his song.</p>

<p>In adding to this series, as the writer has, for many
years, been urged to do, and answering as steadfast a
demand of Benj. F. Johnson's first and oldest friends, it
has been decided that this further work of his be introduced
to the reader of the volume as was the old man's
first work to the reader of the newspaper of nearly ten
years ago.</p>

<p>Directly, then, referring to the Indianapolis "Daily
Journal,"&mdash;under whose management the writer had for
some time been employed,&mdash;from issue of date June 17,
1882, under editorial caption of "A Boone County Pastoral,"
this article is herewith quoted:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Benj. F. Johnson, of Boone county, who considers the Journal
a "very valubul" newspaper, writes to enclose us an original
poem, desiring that we kindly accept it for publication, as
"many neghbors and friends is astin' him to have the same
struck off."</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson thoughtfully informs us that he is "no edjucated
man," but that he has, "from childhood up tel old enough to
vote, allus wrote more er less poetry, as many of an albun in
the neghborhood can testify." Again, he says that he writes
"from the hart out"; and there is a touch of genuine pathos in
the frank avowal, "Thare is times when I write the tears rolls
down my cheeks."</p>

<p>In all sincerity, Mr. Johnson, we are glad to publish the poem
you send, and just as you have written it. That is its greatest
charm. Its very defects compose its excellence. You need no
better education than the one from which emanates "The Old
Swimmin'-Hole." It is real poetry, and all the more tender and
lovable for the unquestionable evidence it bears of having been
written "from the hart out." The only thing we find to&mdash;but
hold! Let us first lay the poem before the reader:</p></div>

<p>Here followed the poem, "The Old Swimmin'-Hole,"
entire&mdash;the editorial comment ending as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The only thing now, Mr. Johnson&mdash;as we were about to observe&mdash;the
only thing we find to criticise, at all relative to the
poem, is your closing statement to the effect that "It was
wrote to go to the tune of 'The Captin with his Whiskers!'"
You should not have told us that, O Rare Ben. Johnson!</p></div>

<p>A week later, in the "Journal" of date June 24th,
followed this additional mention of "Benj. F. Johnson,
of Boone":</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is a pleasure for us to note that the publication of the
poem of "The Old Swimmin'-Hole," to which the Journal, with
just pride, referred last week, has proved almost as great a pleasure
to its author as to the hosts of delighted readers who have
written in its praise, or called to personally indorse our high
opinion of its poetic value. We have just received a letter from
Mr. Johnson, the author, inclosing us another lyrical performance,
which in many features even surpasses the originality and
spirit of the former effort. Certainly the least that can be said
of it is that it stands a thorough proof of our first assertion, that
the author, though by no means a man of learning and profound
literary attainments, is none the less a true poet and an artist.
The letter, accompanying this later amaranth of blooming wildwood
verse, we publish in its entirety, assured that Mr. Johnson's
many admirers will be charmed, as we have been, at the
delicious glimpse he gives us of his inspiration, modes of study,
home-life, and surroundings:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To the Editer of the Indanoplus Jurnal:</p>

<p>"Respected Sir&mdash;The paper is here, markin' the old swimmin'-hole,
my poetry which you seem to like so well. I joy to
see it in print, and I thank you, hart and voice, fer speakin' of
its merrits in the way in which you do. I am glad you thought
it was real poetry, as you said in your artikle. But I make
bold to ast you what was your idy in sayin' I had ortent of told
you it went to the tune I spoke of in my last. I felt highly
flatered tel I got that fur. Was it because you don't know the
tune refered to in the letter? Er wasent some words spelt
right er not? Still ef you hadent of said somepin' aginst it Ide
of thought you was makin' fun. As I said before I well know
my own unedjucation, but I don't think that is any reason the
feelin's of the soul is stunted in theyr growth however. 'Juge
not less ye be juged,' says The Good Book, and so say I, ef I
thought you was makin' fun of the lines that I wrote and which
you done me the onner to have printed off in sich fine style that
I have read it over and over again in the paper you sent, and I
would like to have about three more ef you can spare the same
and state by mail what they will come at. All nature was in
tune day before yisterday when your paper come to hand. It
had ben a-raining hard fer some days, but that morning opened
up as clear as a whissel. No clouds was in the sky, and the air
was bammy with the warm sunshine and the wet smell of the
earth and the locus blossoms and the flowrs and pennyroil and
boneset. I got up, the first one about the place, and went forth
to the plesant fields. I fed the stock with lavish hand and
wortered them in merry glee, they was no bird in all the land
no happier than me. I have jest wrote a verse of poetry in this
letter; see ef you can find it. I also send you a whole poem
which was wrote off the very day your paper come. I started it
in the morning I have so feebly tride to pictur' to you and
wound her up by suppertime, besides doin' a fare day's work
around the place.</p>

<p>"Ef you print this one I think you will like it better than the
other. This ain't a sad poem like the other was, but you will
find it full of careful thought. I pride myself on that. I also
send you 30 cents in stamps fer you to take your pay out of fer
the other papers I said, and also fer three more with this in it ef
you have it printed and oblige. Ef you don't print this poem,
keep the stamps and send me three more papers with <i>the other
one</i> in&mdash;makin' the sum totul of six (6) papers altogether in full.
Ever your true friend,</p>

<p class="author">Benj. F. Johnson.</p>

<p>"N. B.&mdash;The tune of this one is 'The Bold Privateer.'"</p></div></div>

<p>Here followed the poem, "Thoughts Fer The Discuraged
Farmer";&mdash;and here, too, fittingly ends any
comment but that which would appear trivial and
gratuitous.</p>

<p>Simply, in briefest conclusion, the hale, sound, artless,
lovable character of Benj. F. Johnson remains, in the
writer's mind, as from the first, far less a fiction than a
living, breathing, vigorous reality.&mdash;So strong, indeed,
has his personality been made manifest, that many times,
in visionary argument with the sturdy old myth over certain
changes from the original forms of his productions,
he has so incontinently beaten down all suggestions as to
a less incongruous association of thoughts and words,
together with protests against his many violations of
poetic method, harmony, and grace, that nothing was
left the writer but to submit to what has always seemed&mdash;and
in truth still seems&mdash;a superior wisdom of dictation.</p>

<h2>AN OLD SETTLER'S STORY</h2>


<p>William Williams his name was&mdash;er so he said;&mdash;Bill
Williams they called him, and them 'at knowed him
best called him Bill Bills.</p>

<p>The first I seed o' Bills was about two weeks after he
got here. The Settlement wasn't nothin' but a baby in
them days, fer I mind 'at old Ezry Sturgiss had jist got
his saw and griss-mill a-goin', and Bills had come along
and claimed to know all about millin', and got a job
with him; and millers in them times was wanted
worse'n congerssmen, and I reckon got better wages;
fer afore Ezry built, there wasn't a dust o' meal er flour
to be had short o' the White Water, better'n sixty mil'd
from here, the way we had to fetch it. And they used
to come to Ezry's fer their grindin' as fur as that; and
one feller I knowed to come from what used to be the
old South Fork, over eighty mil'd from here, and in the
wettest, rainyest weather; and mud! <i>Law!</i></p>

<p>Well, this-here Bills was a-workin' fer Ezry at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
time&mdash;part the time a-grindin', and part the time
a-lookin' after the sawin', and gittin' out timber and the
like. Bills was a queer-lookin' feller, shore! About as
tall a build man as Tom Carter&mdash;but of course you
don't know nothin' o' Tom Carter. A great big hulk
of a feller, Tom was; and as fur back as Fifty-eight
used to make his brags that he could cut and putt up his
seven cord a day.</p>

<p>Well, what give Bills this queer look, as I was a-goin'
on to say, was a great big ugly scar a-runnin' from the
corner o' one eye clean down his face and neck, and I
don't know how fur down his breast&mdash;awful lookin'; and
he never shaved, and there wasn't a hair a-growin' in that
scar, and it looked like a&mdash;some kind o' pizen snake er
somepin' a-crawlin' in the grass and weeds. I never
seed sich a' out-and-out ornry-lookin' chap, and I'll
never fergit the first time I set eyes on him.</p>

<p>Steve and me&mdash;Steve was my youngest brother;
Steve's be'n in Californy now fer, le' me see,&mdash;well,
anyways, I rickon, over thirty year.&mdash;Steve was a-drivin'
the team at the time&mdash;I allus let Steve drive; 'peared
like Steve was made a-purpose fer hosses. The beatin'est<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
hand with hosses 'at ever you <i>did</i> see and-I-know!
W'y, a hoss, after he got kindo' used to Steve a-handlin'
of him, would do anything fer <i>him</i>! And I've
knowed that boy to swap fer hosses 'at couldn't hardly
make a shadder; and, afore you knowed it, Steve would
have 'em a-cavortin' around a-lookin' as peert and fat
and slick!</p>

<p>Well, we'd come over to Ezry's fer some grindin'
that day; and Steve wanted to price some lumber fer a
house, intendin' to marry that Fall&mdash;and would a-married,
I reckon, ef the girl hadn't a-died jist as she'd got
her weddin' clothes done&mdash;and that set hard on Steve
fer a while. Yit he rallied, you know, as a youngster
will; but he never married, someway&mdash;never married.
Reckon he never found no other woman he could love
well enough&mdash;'less it was&mdash;well, no odds.&mdash;The Good
Bein's jedge o' what's best fer each and all.</p>

<p>We lived <i>then</i> about eight mil'd from Ezry's, and it
tuck about a day to make the trip; so you kin kindo'
git an idy o' how the roads was in them days.</p>

<p>Well, on the way over I noticed Steve was mighty
quiet-like, but I didn't think nothin' of it, tel at last he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
says, says he, "Ben, I want you to kindo' keep an eye
out fer Ezry's new hand"&mdash;meanin' Bills. And then
I kindo' suspicioned somepin' o' nother was up betwixt
'em; and shore enough there was, as I found out afore
the day was over.</p>

<p>I knowed 'at Bills was a mean sort of a man, from
what I'd heerd. His name was all over the neighberhood
afore he'd be'n here two weeks.</p>

<p>In the first place, he come in a suspicious sorto' way:
Him and his wife, and a little baby on'y a few months
old, come through in a kivvered wagon with a fambly
a-goin' som'ers in The Illinoy; and they stopped at the
mill, fer some meal er somepin', and Bills got to talkin'
with Ezry 'bout millin', and one thing o' nother, and
said he was expeerenced some 'bout a mill hisse'f, and
told Ezry ef he'd give him work he'd stop; said his
wife and baby wasn't strong enough to stand trav'lin',
and ef Ezry'd give him work he was ready to lick into
it then and there; said his woman could pay her board
by sewin' and the like, tel they got ahead a little; and
then, ef he liked the neighberhood, he said he'd as lif
settle there as anywheres; he was huntin' a home, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
said, and the outlook kindo' struck him, and his woman
railly needed rest, and wasn't strong enough to go much
furder. And old Ezry kindo' tuk pity on the feller;
and havin' house-room to spare, and railly in need of a
good hand at the mill, he said all right; and so the feller
stopped and the wagon druv ahead and left 'em;
and they didn't have no things ner nothin'&mdash;not even a
cyarpet-satchel, ner a stitch o' clothes, on'y what they
had on their backs. And I think it was the third er
fourth day after Bills stopped 'at he whirped Tomps
Burk, the bully o' here them days, tel you wouldn't
a-knowed him!</p>

<p>Well, I'd heerd o' this, and the facts is I'd made up
my mind 'at Bills was a bad stick, and the place wasn't
none the better fer his bein' here. But, as I was a-goin'
on to say,&mdash;as Steve and me driv up to the mill, I
ketched sight o' Bills the first thing, a-lookin' out o'
where some boards was knocked off, jist over the worter-wheel;
and he knowed Steve&mdash;I could see that by his
face; and he hollered somepin', too, but what it was I
couldn't jist make out, fer the noise o' the wheel; but
he looked to me as ef he'd hollered somepin' mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
a-purpose so's Steve <i>wouldn't</i> hear it, and <i>he'd</i> have the
consolation o' knowin' 'at he'd called Steve some ornry
name 'thout givin' him a <i>chance</i> to take it up. Steve
was allus quiet-like, but ef you raised his dander onc't&mdash;and
you could do that 'thout much trouble, callin' him
names er somepin', particular' anything 'bout his mother.
Steve loved his mother&mdash;allus loved his mother, and
would fight fer her at the drap o' the hat. And he was
her favo-<i>rite</i>&mdash;allus a-talkin' o' "her boy, Steven," as
she used to call him, and so proud of him, and so keerful
of him allus, when he'd be sick or anything; nuss
him like a baby, she would.</p>

<p>So when Bills hollered, Steve didn't pay no attention;
and <i>I</i> said nothin', o' course, and didn't let on like I
noticed him. So we druv round to the south side and
hitched; and Steve 'lowed he'd better feed; so I left
him with the hosses and went into the mill.</p>

<p>They was jist a-stoppin' fer dinner. Most of 'em
brought ther dinners&mdash;lived so fur away, you know. The
two Smith boys lived on what used to be the old Warrick
farm, five er six mild, anyhow, from where the mill
stood. Great stout fellers, they was; and little Jake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the father of 'em, wasn't no man at all&mdash;not much bigger'n
you, I rickon. Le' me see, now:&mdash;There was
Tomps Burk, Wade Elwood, and Joe and Ben Carter;
and Wesley Morris, John Coke&mdash;wiry little cuss, he
was, afore he got his leg sawed off;&mdash;and Ezry, and&mdash;Well,
I don't jist mind <i>all</i> the boys&mdash;'s a long time ago,
and I never was much of a hand fer names.&mdash;Now,
some folks'll hear a name and never fergit it, but I
can't boast of a good rickollection, 'specially o' names;
and fer the last thirty year my mem'ry's be'n a-failin'
me, ever sence a spell o' fever 'at I brought on onc't&mdash;fever
and rheumatiz together:&mdash;You see, I went a-sainin'
with a passel o' the boys, fool-like, and let my clothes
freeze on me a-comin' home. W'y, my breeches was
like stove-pipes when I pulled 'em off. 'Ll, ef I didn't
pay fer <i>that</i> spree! Rheumatiz got a holt o' me and
helt me there flat o' my back fer eight weeks, and
couldn't move hand er foot 'thout a-hollerin' like a' Injun.
And I'd a-be'n there yit, I rickon, ef it hadn't a-be'n fer
a' old hoss-doctor, name o' Jones; and he gits a lot o'
sod and steeps it in hot whiskey and pops it on me,&mdash;and
I'll be-switched-to-death ef it didn't cuore me up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
fer all I laughed and told him I'd better take the whiskey
in'ardly and let him keep the grass fer his doctor
bill. But that's nuther here ner there!&mdash;As I was
a-sayin' 'bout the mill: As I went in, the boys had
stopped work and was a-gittin' down their dinners, and
Bills amongst 'em, and old Ezry a-chattin' away&mdash;great
hand, he was, fer his joke, and allus a-cuttin' up and
a-gittin' off his odd-come-shorts on the boys. And that
day he was in particular good humor. He'd brought
some liquor down fer the boys, and he'd be'n drinkin' a
little hisse'f, enough to feel it. He didn't drink much&mdash;that
is to say, he didn't git drunk adzactly; but he
tuk his dram, you understand. You see, they made
their own whiskey in them days, and it wasn't nothin'
like the bilin' stuff you git now. Old Ezry had a little
still, and allus made his own whiskey, enough fer fambly
use, and jist as puore as worter, and as harmless.
But now-a-days the liquor you git's rank pizen. They
say they putt tobacker in it, and strychnine, and the
Lord knows what; ner I never knowed why, 'less it
was to give it a richer-lookin' flavor, like. Well, Ezry
he'd brought up a jug, and the boys had be'n a-takin' it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
purty free; I seed that as quick as I went in. And old
Ezry called out to <i>me</i> to come and take some, the first
thing. Told him I didn't b'lieve I keered about it; but
nothin' would do but I must take a drink with the boys;
and I was tired anyhow and I thought a little wouldn't
hurt; so I takes a swig; and as I set the jug down
<i>Bills</i> spoke up and says, "You're a stranger to me, and
I'm a stranger to you, but I rickon we can drink to our
better acquaintance,"&mdash;er somepin' to that amount, and
poured out another snifter in a gourd he'd be'n a-drinkin'
coffee in, and handed it to me. Well, I couldn't well
refuse, of course; so I says "Here's to us," and drunk
her down&mdash;mighty nigh a half pint, I rickon. Now, I
railly didn't want it, but, as I tell you, I was obleeged to
take it, and I downed her at a swaller and never batted an
eye, fer, to tell the fact about it, I liked the taste o'
liquor; and I do <i>yit</i>, on'y I know when I' got enough.
Jist then I didn't want to drink on account o' Steve.
Steve couldn't abide liquor in no shape ner form&mdash;fer
medicine ner nothin', and I've allus thought it was his
mother's doin's.</p>

<p>Now, a few months afore this I'd be'n to Vincennes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
and I was jist a-tellin' Ezry what they was a-astin' fer
their liquor there&mdash;fer I'd fetched a couple o' gallon home
with me 'at I'd paid six bits fer, and pore liquor at that:
And I was a-tellin' about it, and old Ezry was a-sayin'
what an oudacious figger that was, and how he could
make money a-sellin' it fer half that price, and was
a-goin' on a-braggin' about his liquor&mdash;and it was a good
article&mdash;fer new whiskey,&mdash;and jist then Steve comes
in, jist as Bills was a-sayin' 'at a man 'at wouldn't
drink <i>that</i> whiskey wasn't no man at all! So, of
course, when they ast <i>Steve</i> to take some and he told
'em no, 'at he was much obleeged, Bills was kindo' tuk
down, you understand, and had to say somepin'; and
says he, "I reckon you ain't no better'n the rest of us,
and <i>we've</i> be'n a-drinkin' of it." But Steve didn't let
on like he noticed Bills at all, and retch and shuk hands
with the other boys and ast how they was all a-comin' on.</p>

<p>I seed Bills was riled, and more'n likely wanted trouble;
and shore enough, he went on to say, kindo snarlin'-like,
'at "he'd knowed o' men in his day 'at had
be'n licked fer refusin' to drink when their betters ast
em"; and said furder 'at "a lickin' wasn't none too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
good fer anybody 'at would refuse liquor like that o'
Ezry's, and in his own house too"&mdash;er <i>buildin'</i>, ruther.
Ezry shuk his head at him, but I seed 'at Bills was
bound fer a quarrel, and I winks at Steve, as much as to
say, "Don't you let him bully you; you'll find your
brother here to see you have fair play!" <i>I</i> was a-feelin'
my oats some about then, and Steve seed I was, and
looked so sorry-like, and like his mother, 'at I jist
thought, "I <i>kin</i> fight fer <i>you</i>, and <i>die</i> fer you, 'cause
you're wuth it!"&mdash;And I didn't someway feel like it
would amount to much ef I <i>did</i> die er git killed er
somepin' on <i>his</i> account. I seed Steve was mighty
white around the mouth, and his eyes was a-glitterin'
like a snake's; yit Bills didn't seem to take warnin', but
went on to say 'at "he'd knowed boys 'at loved their
mothers so well they couldn't drink nothin' stronger'n
milk."&mdash;And then you'd ort o' seed Steve's coat fly off,
jist like it wanted to git out of his way and give the boy
room accordin' to his stren'th. I seed Bills grab a
piece o' scantlin' jist in time to ketch his arm as he
struck at Steve,&mdash;for Steve was a-comin' fer him dangerss.
But they'd ketched Steve from behind jist then;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
and Bills turned fer me. I seed him draw back, and I
seed Steve a-scufflin' to ketch his arm; but he didn't
reach it quite in time to do me no good. It must
a-come awful suddent. The first I rickollect was a
roarin' and a buzzin' in my ears, and when I kindo'
come a little better to, and crawled up and peeked over
the saw-log I was a-layin' the other side of, I seed a
couple clinched and a-rollin' over and over and a-makin'
the chips and saw-dust fly, now I <i>tell</i> you! Bills and
Steve it was&mdash;head and tail, tooth and toe-nail, and
a-bleedin' like good fellers! I seed a gash o' some
kind in Bills's head, and Steve was purty well tuckered
and a-pantin' like a lizard; and I made a rush
in, and one o' the Carter boys grabbed me and told
me to jist keep cool&mdash;'at <i>Steve</i> didn't need no he'p,
and they might need me to keep Bills's friends off
ef <i>they</i> made a rush. By this time Steve had whirlt
Bills, and was a-jist a-gittin' in a fair way to finish him
up in good style, when Wesley Morris run in&mdash;I seed
him do it&mdash;run in, and afore we could ketch him he
struck Steve a deadener in the butt o' the ear and knocked
him as limber as a rag. And then Bills whirlt Steve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
and got him by the th'oat, and Ben Carter and me and old
Ezry closed in.&mdash;Carter tackled Morris, and Ezry and me
grabs Bills&mdash;and as old Ezry grabbed him to pull him
off, Bills kindo' give him a side swipe o' some kind and
knocked him&mdash;I don't know <i>how</i> fur! And jist then Carter
and Morris come a-scufflin' back'ards right amongst
us, and Carter th'owed him right acrost Bills and Steve.
Well, it ain't fair, and I don't like to tell it, but I seed
it was the last chance and I tuk advantage of it:&mdash;As
Wesley and Ben fell it pulled Bills down in a kindo'
twist, don't you understand, so's he couldn't he'p hisse'f,
yit still a-clinchin' Steve by the th'oat, and him black in
the face.&mdash;Well, as they fell I grabbed up a little hick'ry
limb, not bigger'n my two thumbs, and I struck Bills a
little tap kindo' over the back of his head like, and,
blame me! ef he didn't keel over like a stuck pig&mdash;and
not any too soon, nuther,&mdash;fer he had Steve's chunk as
nigh putt out as you ever seed a man's, to come to agin.
But he was up th'reckly and ready to a-went at it ef Bills
could a-come to the scratch; but Mister Bills he wasn't
in no fix to try it over! After a-waitin' a while fer him
to come to, and him not a-comin' to, we concluded 'at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
we'd better he'p him, maybe. And we worked with him,
and warshed him, and drenched him with whiskey, but it
'peared like it wasn't no use.&mdash;He jist laid there with his
eyes about half shet, and a-breathin' like a hoss when he's
bad sceart; and I'll be dad-limbed ef I don't believe he'd
a-<i>died</i> on our hands ef it hadn't a-happened old Doc Zions
come a-ridin' past on his way home from the Murdock
neighberhood, where they was a-havin' sich a time with
the milk-sick. And he examined Bills, and had him laid
on a plank and carried down to the house&mdash;'bout a mil'd,
I reckon, from the mill. Looked kindo' cur'ous to see
Steve a-he'ppin' pack the feller, after his nearly chokin'
him to death. Oh, it was a bloody fight, I tell you!
W'y, they wasn't a man in the mill 'at didn't have a
black eye er somepin'; and old Ezry, where Bills hit him,
had his nose broke, and was as bloody as a butcher. And
you'd ort a-seed the women-folks when our p'session come
a-bringin' Bills in. I never seed anybody take on like
Bills's woman.&mdash;It was distressin'; it was, indeed.&mdash;Went
into hysterics, she did; and we thought fer a while
she'd gone plum crazy, fer she cried so pitiful over him,
and called him "Charley! Charley!" 'stid of his right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
name, and went on, clean out of her head, tel she finally
jist fainted clean away.</p>

<p>Fer three weeks Bills laid betwixt life and death, and
that woman set by him night and day, and tended him
as patient as a' angel&mdash;and she <i>was</i> a' angel, too; and
he'd a-never lived to bother nobody agin ef it hadn't
a-be'n fer Annie, as he called her. Zions said there was
a 'brazure of the&mdash;some kind o' p'tuber'nce, and ef he'd
a-be'n struck jist a quarter of a' inch below&mdash;jist a quarter
of a' inch&mdash;he'd a be'n a dead man. And I've
sence wished&mdash;not 'at I want the life of a human bein'
to account fer&mdash;on'y,&mdash;well, no odds&mdash;I've sence wished
'at I <i>had</i> a-hit him jist a quarter of a' inch below!</p>

<p>Well, of course, them days they wasn't no law o' no
account, and nothin' was ever done about it. So Steve
and me got our grindin', and talked the matter over with
Ezry and the boys. Ezry said he was a-goin' to do all
he could fer Bills, 'cause he was a good hand, and when
he wasn't drinkin' they wasn't no peaceabler man in the
Settlement. I kindo' suspicioned what was up, but I
said nothin' then. And Ezry said furder, as we was
about drivin' off, that Bills was a despert feller, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
was best to kindo' humor him a little. "And you must
kindo' be on you guard," he says, "and I'll watch him,
and ef anything happens 'at I git wind of I'll let you
know," he says; and so we putt out fer home.</p>

<p>Mother tuk on awful about it. You see, she thought
she'd be'n the whole blame of it, 'cause the Sunday
afore that her and Steve had went to meetin', and they
got there late, and the house was crowded, and Steve
had ast Bills to give up his seat to Mother, and he
wouldn't do it, and said somepin' 'at disturbed the
prayin', and the preacher prayed 'at the feller 'at was
a-makin' the disturbance might be forgive'; and that
riled Bills so he got up and left, and hung around till it
broke up, so's he could git a chance at Steve to pick a
fight. And he did <i>try</i> it, and dared Steve and double-dared
him fer a fight, but Mother begged so hard 'at she
kep' him out of it. Steve said 'at he'd a-told me all
about it on the way to Ezry's on'y he'd promised
Mother, you know, not to say nothin' to me.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />

<p>Ezry was over at our house about six weeks after the
fight, appearantly as happy as you please. We ast him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
how him and Bills was a-makin' it, and he said firstrate;
said 'at Bills was jist a-doin' splendid; said he'd got
moved in his new house 'at he'd fixed up fer him, and
ever'thing was a-goin' on as smooth as could be; and
Bills and the boys was on better terms'n ever; and says
he, "As fur as you and Steve's concerned, Bills don't
'pear to bear you no ill feelin's, and says as fur as he's
concerned the thing's settled." "Well," says I, "Ezry,
I hope so; but I can't he'p but think they's somepin'
at the bottom of all this"; and says I, "I don't
think it's in Bills to ever amount to anything good";
and says I, "It's my opinion they's a dog in the well,
and now you mark it!"</p>

<p>Well, he said he <i>wasn't</i> jist easy, but maybe he'd
come out all right; said he couldn't turn the feller off&mdash;he
hadn't the heart to do that, with that-air pore, dilicate
woman o' his, and the baby. And then he went
on to tell what a smart sorto' woman Bills's wife was,&mdash;one
of the nicest little women he'd ever laid eyes on,
said she was; said she was the kindest thing, and the
sweetest-tempered, and all&mdash;and the handiest woman
'bout the house, and 'bout sewin', and cookin', and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
like, and all kinds o' housework; and so good to the
childern, and all; and how they all got along so well;
and how proud she was of her baby, and allus a-goin'
on about it and a-cryin' over it and a-carryin' on, and
wouldn't leave it out of her sight a minute. And Ezry
said 'at she could write so purty, and made sich purty
pictur's fer the childern; and how they all liked her
better'n their own mother. And, sence she'd moved,
he said it seemed so lonesome-like 'thout <i>her</i> about the
house&mdash;like they'd lost one o' their own fambly; said
they didn't git to see her much now, on'y sometimes,
when her man would be at work, she'd run over fer a
while, and kiss all the childern and women-folks about
the place,&mdash;the greatest hand fer the childern, she was;
tell 'em all sorts o' little stories, you know, and sing fer
'em; said 'at she could sing so sweet-like, 'at time and
time agin she'd break clean down in some song o'
nother, and her voice would trimble so mournful-like 'at
you'd find yourse'f a-cryin' afore you knowed it. And
she used to coax Ezry's woman to let her take the childern
home with her; and they used to allus want to go,
tel Bills come onc't while they was there, and they said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
he got to jawin' her fer a-makin' some to-do over the
baby, and swore at her and tuk it away from her and
whirped it fer cryin', and <i>she</i> cried and told him to
whirp her and not little Annie, and he said that was jist
what he <i>was</i> a-doin'. And the childern was allus afeard
to go there any more after that&mdash;'feard he'd come home
and whirp little Annie agin. Ezry said he jist done
that to skeer 'em away&mdash;'cause he didn't want a passel
o' childern a-whoopin' and a-howlin' and a-trackin'
round the house all the time.</p>

<p>But, shore enough, Bills, after the fight, 'peared like
he'd settled down, and went 'bout his business so stiddy-like,
and worked so well, the neighbers begin to think
he was all right after all, and railly <i>some</i> got to <i>likin'</i>
him. But fer <i>me</i>,&mdash;well, I was a leetle slow to argy 'at
the feller wasn't "a-possumin'." But the next time I
went over to the mill&mdash;and Steve went with me&mdash;old
Ezry come and met us, and said 'at Bills didn't have no
hard feelin's ef <i>we</i> didn't and 'at he wanted us to fergive
him; said 'at Bills wanted him to tell us 'at he was sorry
the way he'd acted, and wanted us to fergive him. Well,
I looked at Ezry, and we both looked at him, jist perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
tuk back&mdash;the idee o' Bills a-wantin' anybody to <i>fergive
him</i>! And says I, "Ezry, what in the name o' common
sense do you mean?" And says he, "I mean jist what
I say; Bills jined meetin' last night and had 'em all
a-prayin' fer him; and we all had <i>a glorious time</i>," says
old Ezry; "and his woman was there and jined, too, and
prayed and shouted and tuk on to beat all; and Bills
got up and spoke and give in his experience, and said
he'd be'n a bad man, but, glory to God, them times was
past and gone; said 'at he wanted all of 'em to pray fer
him, and he wanted to prove faithful, and wanted all his
inemies to fergive him; and prayed 'at you and Steve
and your folks would fergive him, and ever'body 'at he
ever wronged anyway." And old Ezry was a-goin' on,
and his eyes a-sparklin', and a-rubbin' his hands, he was
so excited and tickled over it, 'at Steve and me we jist
stood there a-gawkin' like, tel Bills hisse'f come up and
retch out one hand to Steve and one to me; and Steve
shuk with him kindo' oneasy-like, and I&mdash;well, sir, I
never felt cur'oser in my born days than I did that minute.
The cold chills crep' over me, and I shuk as ef I
had the agur, and I folded my hands behind me and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
looked that feller square in the eye, and I tried to speak
three or four times afore I could make it, and when I
did, my voice wasn't natchurl&mdash;sounded like a feller
a-whisperin' through a tin horn er somepin'.&mdash;And I says,
says I, "You're a liar," slow and delibert. That was all.
His eyes blazed a minute, and drapped; and he turned,
'thout a word, and walked off. And Ezry says, "He's
in airnest; I know he's in airnest, er he'd a-never a-tuk
that!" And so he went on, tel finally Steve jined in,
and betwixt 'em they p'suaded me 'at I was in the wrong
and the best thing to do was to make it all up, which I
finally did. And Bills said 'at he'd a-never a-felt jist
right 'thout <i>my</i> friendship, fer he'd wronged me, he said,
and he'd wronged Steve and Mother, too, and he wanted
a chance, he said, o' makin' things straight agin.</p>

<p>Well, a-goin' home, I don't think Steve and me talked o'
nothin' else but Bills&mdash;how airnest the feller acted 'bout
it, and how, ef he <i>wasn't</i> in airnest, he'd a-never a-swallered
that "lie," you see. That's what walked my
log, fer he could a-jist as easy a-knocked me higher'n
Kilgore's kite as he could to walk away 'thout a-doin'
of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Mother was awful tickled when she heerd about it, fer
she'd had an idee 'at we'd have trouble afore we got
back, and a-gitten home safe, and a-bringin' the news
'bout Bills a-jinin' church and all, tickled her so 'at she
mighty nigh shouted fer joy. You see, Mother was a'
old church-member all her life; and I don't think she
ever missed a sermont er a prayer-meetin' 'at she could
possibly git to&mdash;rain er shine, wet er dry. When they
was a meetin' of any kind a-goin' on, go she would, and
nothin' short o' sickness in the fambly, er knowin' nothin'
of it, would stop <i>her</i>! And clean up to her dyin' day
she was a God-fearin' and consistent Christian ef they
ever was one. I mind now when she was tuk with her
last spell and laid bedfast fer eighteen months, she used
to tell the preacher, when he'd come to see her and pray
and go on, 'at she could die happy ef she could on'y be
with 'em all agin in their love-feasts and revivals. She
was purty low then, and had be'n a-failin' fast fer a day er
two; and that day they'd be'n a-holdin' service at the
house. It was her request, you know, and the neighbers
had congergated and was a-prayin' and a-singin' her
favorite hymns&mdash;one in p'tickler, "God moves in a myster'ous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
way his wunders to p'form," and 'bout his "Walkin'
on the sea and a-ridin' of the storm."&mdash;Well, anyway,
they'd be'n a-singin' that hymn fer her&mdash;she used to sing
that'n so much, I rickollect as fur back as I kin remember;
and I mind how it used to make me feel so lonesome-like
and solemn, don't you know,&mdash;when I'd be a-knockin'
round the place along o' evenings, and she'd be a-milkin',
and I'd hear her, at my feedin', way off by myse'f, and it
allus somehow made me feel like a feller'd ort 'o try and
live as nigh right as the law allows, and that's about my
doctern yit. Well, as I was a-goin' on to say, they'd jist
finished that old hymn, and Granny Lowry was jist a-goin'
to lead in prayer, when I noticed Mother kindo' tried to
turn herse'f in bed, and smiled so weak and faint-like,
and looked at me, with her lips a-kindo' movin'; and I
thought maybe she wanted another dos't of her syrup
'at Ezry's woman had fixed up fer her, and I kindo'
stooped down over her and ast her ef she wanted anything.
"Yes," she says, and nodded, and her voice
sounded so low and solemn and so fur-away-like 'at I
knowed she'd never take no more medicine on this airth.
And I tried to ast her what it was she wanted, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
couldn't say nothin'; my throat hurt me, and I felt the
warm tears a-boolgin' up, and her kind old face a-glimmerin'
away so pale-like afore my eyes, and still
a-smilin' up so lovin' and forgivin' and so good 'at it
made me think so fur back in the past I seemed to be a
little boy agin; and seemed like her thin gray hair was
brown and a-shinin' in the sun as it used to do when she
helt me on her shoulder in the open door, when Father
was a-livin' and we used to go to meet him at the bars;
seemed like her face was young agin, and a-smilin'
like it allus used to be, and her eyes as full o' hope and
happiness as afore they ever looked on grief er ever
shed a tear. And I thought of all the trouble they had
saw on my account, and of all the lovin' words her lips
had said, and of all the thousand things her pore old
hands had done fer me 'at I never even thanked her
fer; and how I loved her better'n all the world besides,
and would be so lonesome ef she went away.&mdash;Lord!
I can't tell you what I <i>didn't</i> think and feel
and see. And I knelt down by her, and she whispered
then fer Steven, and he come, and we kissed her&mdash;and
she died&mdash;a-smilin' like a child&mdash;jist like a child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>Well&mdash;well! 'Pears like I'm allus a-runnin' into
somepin' else. I wisht I <i>could</i> tell a story 'thout driftin'
off in matters 'at hain't no livin' thing to do with
what I started out with. I try to keep from thinkin' of
afflictions and the like, 'cause sich is bound to come to
the best of us; but a feller's rickollection will bring 'em
up, and I reckon it'd ort'o be er it wouldn't be; and I've
thought, sometimes, it was done maybe to kindo' admonish
a feller, as the Good Book says, of how good a
world'd be 'thout no sorrow in it.</p>

<p>Where was I? Oh, yes, I rickollect;&mdash;about Bills
a-jinin' church. Well, sir, they wasn't a better-actin'
feller and more religious-like in all the neighberhood.
Spoke in meetin's, he did, and tuk a' active part in all
religious doin's, and, in fact, was jist as square a man,
appearantly, as the preacher hisse'f. And about six er
eight weeks after he'd jined, they got up another revival,
and things run high. They was a big excitement,
and ever'body was a'tendin' from fur and near. Bills
and Ezry got the mill-hands to go, and didn't talk o'
nothin' <i>but</i> religion. People thought awhile 'at old
Ezry'd turn preacher, he got so interested 'bout church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
matters. He was easy excited 'bout anything; and
when he went into a thing it was in dead airnest,
shore!&mdash;"jist flew off the handle," as I heerd a comical
feller git off onc't. And him and Bills was up and at
it ever' night&mdash;prayin' and shoutin' at the top o' their
voice. Them railly did seem like good times&mdash;when
ever'body jined together, and prayed and shouted hosanner,
and danced around together, and hugged each
other like they was so full o' glory they jist couldn't
he'p theirse'v's!&mdash;That's the reason <i>I</i> jined; it looked
so kindo' whole-souled-like and good, you understand.
But law! I didn't hold out&mdash;on'y fer a little while, and
no wunder!</p>

<p>Well, about them times Bills was tuk down with the
agur; first got to chillin' ever'-other-day, then <i>ever'</i> day,
and harder and harder, tel sometimes he'd be obleeged
to stay away from meetin' on account of it. And onc't
I was at meetin' when he told about it, and how when
he couldn't be with 'em he allus prayed at home, and he
said 'at he believed his prayers was answered, fer onc't
he'd prayed fer a new outpourin' of the Holy Sperit,
and that very night they was three new jiners. And another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
time he said 'at he'd prayed 'at Wesley Morris
would jine, and lo and behold you! he <i>did</i> jine, and the
very night 'at he <i>prayed</i> he would.</p>

<p>Well, the night I'm a-speakin' of he'd had a chill the
day afore and couldn't go that night, and was in bed
when Ezry druv past fer him; said he'd like to go, but
had a high fever and couldn't. And then Ezry's woman
ast him ef he was too sick to spare Annie; and he said
no, they could take her and the baby: and told her to
fix his medicine so's he could reach it 'thout gittin' out
o' bed, and he'd git along 'thout her. And so she tuk
the baby and went along with Ezry and his folks.</p>

<p>I was at meetin' that night and rickollect 'em comin'
in. Annie got a seat jist behind me&mdash;Steve give her
his'n and stood up; and I rickollect a-astin' her how
Bills was a-gittin' along with the agur; and little Annie,
the baby, kep' a-pullin' my hair and a-crowin' tel finally
she went to sleep; and Steve ast her mother to let
<i>him</i> hold her&mdash;cutest little thing you ever laid eyes on,
and the very pictur' <i>of</i> her mother.</p>

<p>Old Daddy Barker preached that night, and a mighty
good sermont. His text, ef I rickollect right, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
"workin' out your own salvation"; and when I listen to
preachers nowadays in their big churches and their fine
pulpits, I allus think o' Daddy Barker, and kindo' some
way wisht the old times could come agin, with the
old log meetin'-house with its puncheon-floor, and the
chinkin' in the walls, and old Daddy Barker in the pulpit.
He'd make you feel 'at the Lord could make Hisse'f
at home there, and find jist as abundant comfort in
the old log house as He could in any of your fine-furnished
churches 'at you can't set down in 'thout payin'
fer the privilege, like it was a theatre.</p>

<p>Ezry had his two little girls jine that night, and I
rickollect the preacher made sich a purty prayer about
the Saviour a-cotin' from the Bible 'bout "Suffer little
childern to come unto Me"&mdash;and all; and talked so purty
'bout the jedgment day, and mothers a-meetin' their
little ones there&mdash;and all; and went on tel they wasn't
a dry eye in the house&mdash;And jist as he was a-windin' up,
Abe Riggers stuck his head in at the door and hollered
"Fire!" loud as he could yell. We all rushed out,
a-thinkin' it was the meetin'-house; but he hollered it
was the mill; and shore enough, away off to the south'ards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
we could see the light acrost the woods, and see
the blaze a-lickin' up above the trees. I seed old Ezry
as he come a-scufflin' through the crowd; and we putt
out together fer it. Well, it was two mil'd to the mill,
but by the time we'd half-way got there, we could tell
it wasn't the mill a-burnin', 'at the fire was furder to
the left, and that was Ezry's house; and by the time we
got there it wasn't much use. We pitched into the
household goods, and got out the beddin', and the furnitur'
and cheers, and the like o' that; saved the clock
and a bedstid, and got the bureau purt' nigh out when
they hollered to us 'at the roof was a-cavin' in, and we
had to leave it; well, we'd tuk the drawers out, all but
the big one, and that was locked; and it and all in it
went with the buildin'; and that was a big loss: All
the money 'at Ezry was a-layin' by was in that-air
drawer, and a lot o' keepsakes and trinkets 'at Ezry's
woman said she wouldn't a-parted with fer the world
and all.</p>

<p>I never seed a troubleder fambly than they was. It
jist 'peared like old Ezry give clean down, and the women
and childern a-cryin' and a-takin' on. It looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
jist awful&mdash;shore's you're born!&mdash;Losin' ever'thing
they'd worked so hard fer&mdash;and there it was, purt' nigh
midnight, and a fambly, jist a little while ago all so
happy, and now with no home to go to, ner nothin'!</p>

<p>It was arranged fer Ezry's to move in with Bills&mdash;that
was about the on'y chance&mdash;on'y one room and a
loft; but Bills said they could manage <i>some</i> way, fer a
while anyhow.</p>

<p>Bills said he seed the fire when it first started, and
could a-putt it out ef he'd on'y be'n strong enough to
git there; said he started twic't to go, but was too weak
and had to go back to bed agin; said it was a-blazin'
in the kitchen roof when he first seed it. So the gineral
conclusion 'at we all come to was&mdash;it must a-ketched
from the flue.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />

<p>It was too late in the fall then to think o' buildin' even
the onriest kind o' shanty, and so Ezry moved in with
Bills. And Bills used to say ef it hadn't a-be'n fer Ezry
<i>he'd</i> a-never a-had no house, ner nothin' to putt in it,
nuther! You see, all the household goods 'at Bills had
in the world he'd got of Ezry, and he 'lowed he'd be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
a triflin' whelp ef he didn't do all in <i>his</i> power to make
<i>Ezry</i> perfeckly at home's long as he wanted to stay
there. And together they managed to make room fer
'em all, by a-buildin' a kindo' shed-like to the main
house, intendin' to build when Spring come. And
ever'thing went along first-rate, I guess; never heerd
no complaints&mdash;that is, p'tickler.</p>

<p>Ezry was kindo' down fer a long time, though; didn't
like to talk about his trouble much, and didn't 'tend
meetin' much, like he used to; said it made him think
'bout his house burnin', and he didn't feel safe to lose
sight o' the mill. And the meetin's kindo' broke up
altogether that winter. Almost broke up religious doin's,
it did. 'S long as I've lived here I never seed jist
sich a slack in religion as they was that winter; and 'fore
<i>then</i>, I kin mind the time when they wasn't a night the
whole endurin' winter when they didn't have preachin'
er prayer-meetin' o' some kind a-goin' on. W'y, I
rickollect one night in p'tickler&mdash;the <i>coldest</i> night,
<i>whooh</i>! And somebody had stold the meetin'-house
door, and they was obleeged to preach 'thout it. And
the wind blowed in so they had to hold their hats afore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the candles, and then onc't-in-a-while they'd git sluffed
out. And the snow drifted in so it was jist like settin'
out doors; and they had to stand up when they prayed&mdash;yes-sir!
stood up to pray. I noticed that night they
was a' oncommon lot o' jiners, and I believe to this
day 'at most of 'em jined jist to git up where the stove
was. Lots o' folks had their feet froze right in meetin';
and Steve come home with his ears froze like they
was whittled out o' bone; and he said 'at Mary Madaline
Wells's feet was froze, and she had two pair o'
socks on over her shoes. Oh, it <i>was</i> cold, now I <i>tell</i>
you!</p>

<p>They run the mill part o' that winter&mdash;part they
couldn't. And they didn't work to say stiddy tel along
in Aprile, and then they was snow on the ground yit&mdash;in
the shadders&mdash;and the ground froze, so you couldn't
hardly dig a grave. But at last they got to kindo' jiggin'
along agin. Plenty to do there was; and old Ezry
was mighty tickled, too; 'peared to recruit right up like.
Ezry was allus best tickled when things was a-stirrin',
and then he was a-gittin' ready fer buildin', you know,&mdash;wanted
a house of his own, he said.&mdash;And of course it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
wasn't adzackly like home, all cluttered up as they was
there at Bills's. They got along mighty well, though,
together; and the women-folks and childern got along
the best in the world. Ezry's woman used to say she
never laid eyes on jist sich another woman as Annie was.
Said it was jist as good as a winter's schoolin' fer the
childern; said her two little girls had learnt to read, and
didn't know their a-b abs afore Annie learnt 'em; well,
the oldest one, Mary Patience, she <i>did</i> know her <i>letters</i>,
I guess&mdash;fourteen year old, she was; but Mandy, the
youngest, had never seed inside a book afore that winter;
and the way she learnt was jist su'prisin'. She was
puny-like and frail-lookin' allus, but ever'body 'lowed she
was a heap smarter'n Mary Patience, and she <i>was</i>; and
in my opinion she railly had more sense'n all the rest o'
the childern putt together, 'bout books and cipherin' and
'rethmetic, and the like; and John Wesley, the oldest of
'em, he got to teachin' at last, when he growed up,&mdash;but,
law! he couldn't write his own name so's you could read
it. I allus thought they was a good 'eal of old Ezry in
John Wesley. Liked to romance 'round with the youngsters
'most too well.&mdash;Spiled him fer teachin', I allus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
thought; fer instance, ef a scholard said somepin' funny
in school, John-Wes he'd jist have to have his laugh out
with the rest, and it was jist fun fer the boys, you know,
to go to school to <i>him</i>. Allus in fer spellin'-matches
and the like, and learnin' songs and sich. I rickollect
he give a' exhibition onc't, one winter, and I'll never
fergit it, I rickon.</p>

<p>The school-house would on'y hold 'bout forty, comf'table,
and that night they was up'ards of a hunderd er
more&mdash;jist crammed and jammed! And the benches
was piled back so's to make room fer the flatform they'd
built to make their speeches and dialogues on; and fellers
a-settin' up on them back seats, their heads was clean
aginst the j'ist. It was a low ceilin', anyhow, and o'
course them 'at tuk a part in the doin's was way up, too.
Janey Thompson had to give up her part in a dialogue,
'cause she looked so tall she was afeard the congergation
would laugh at her; and they couldn't git her to come
out and sing in the openin' song 'thout lettin' her set
down first and git ready 'fore they pulled the curtain.
You see, they had sheets sewed together, and fixed on a
string some way, to slide back'ards and for'ards, don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
you know. But they was a big bother to 'em&mdash;couldn't
git 'em to work like. Ever' time they'd git 'em slid 'bout
half-way acrost, somepin' would ketch, and they'd haf
to stop and fool with 'em awhile 'fore they could git 'em
the balance o' the way acrost. Well, finally, to'rds the
last, they jist kep' 'em drawed back all the time. It
was a pore affair, and spiled purt' nigh ever' piece; but
the scholards all wanted it fixed thataway, the teacher
said, in a few appropert remarks he made when the
thing was over. Well, I was a-settin' in the back part
o' the house on them high benches, and my head was jist
even with them on the flatform, and the lights was pore,
and where the string was stretched fer the curtain to
slide on it looked like the p'formers was strung on it.
And when Lige Boyer's boy was a-speakin'&mdash;kindo'
mumbled it, you know, and you couldn't half hear&mdash;it
looked fer the world like he was a-chawin' on that-air
string; and some devilish feller 'lowed ef he'd chaw it
clean in two it'd be a good thing fer the balance. After
that they all sung a sleigh-ridin' song, and it was right
purty, the way they got it off. Had a passel o' sleigh-bells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
they'd ring ever' onc't-in-a-while, and it sounded
purty&mdash;shore!</p>

<p>Then Hunicut's girl, Marindy, read a letter 'bout
winter, and what fun the youngsters allus had in winter-time,
a-sleighin' and the like, and spellin'-matches, and
huskin'-bees, and all. Purty good, it was, and made a
feller think o' old times. Well, that was about the best
thing they was done that night; but everybody said the
teacher wrote it fer her; and I wouldn't be su'prised
much, fer they was married not long afterwards. I expect
he wrote it fer her.&mdash;Wouldn't putt it past Wes!</p>

<p>They had a dialogue, too, 'at was purty good. Little
Bob Arnold was all fixed up&mdash;had on his pap's old bell-crowned
hat, the one he was married in. Well, I jist
thought die I would when I seed that old hat and called
to mind the night his pap was married, and we all got
him a little how-come-you-so on some left-handed cider
'at' had be'n a-layin' in a whiskey-bar'l tel it was strong
enough to bear up a' egg. I kin rickollect now jist how
he looked in that hat, when it was all new, you know,
and a-settin' on the back of his head, and his hair in his
eyes; and sich hair!&mdash;as red as git-out&mdash;and his little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
black eyes a-shinin' like beads. Well-sir, you'd a-died
to a-seed him a-dancin'. We danced all night that
night, and would a-be'n a-dancin' yit, I rickon, ef the
fiddler hadn't a-give out. Wash Lowry was a-fiddlin'
fer us; and along to'rds three er four in the morning
Wash was purty well fagged out. You see, Wash
could never play fer a dance er nothin' 'thout a-drinkin'
more or less, and when he got to a certain pitch you
couldn't git nothin' out o' him but "Barbary Allan";
so at last he struck up on that, and jist kep' it up, and
<i>kep'</i> it up, and nobody couldn't git nothin' else out of
him!</p>

<p>Now, anybody 'at ever danced knows 'at "Barbary
Allan" hain't no tune to dance by, <i>no</i> way you can fix
it; and, o' course, the boys seed at onc't their fun was
gone ef they couldn't git him on another tune.&mdash;And
they'd coax and beg and plead with him, and maybe git
him started on "The Wind Blows over the Barley,"
and 'bout the time they'd git to knockin' it down agin
purty lively, he'd go to sawin' away on "Barbary
Allan"&mdash;and I'll-be-switched-to-death ef that feller
didn't set there and play hisse'f sound asleep on "Barbary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Allan," and we had to wake him up afore he'd
quit! Now, that's jes' the plum facts. And they
wasn't a better fiddler nowheres than Wash Lowry,
when he was at hisse'f. I've heerd a good many fiddlers
in my day, and I never heerd one yit 'at could play
my style o' fiddlin' ekal to Wash Lowry. You see,
Wash didn't play none o' this-here new-fangled music&mdash;nothin'
but the old tunes, you understand, "The
Forkd Deer," and "Old Fat Gal," and "Gray Eagle,"
and the like. Now, them's music! Used to like
to hear Wash play "Gray Eagle." He could come as
nigh a-makin' that old tune talk as ever you heerd!
Used to think a heap o' his fiddle&mdash;and he had a good
one, shore. I've heerd him say, time and time agin,
'at a five-dollar gold-piece wouldn't buy it, and I
knowed him myse'f to refuse a calf fer it onc't&mdash;yes-sir,
a yearland calf&mdash;and the feller offered him a double-bar'l'd
pistol to boot, and blame ef he'd take it; said
he'd ruther part with anything else he owned than his
fiddle.&mdash;But here I am, clean out o' the furry agin!...
Oh, yes; I was a-tellin' 'bout little Bob, with that
old hat; and he had on a swaller-tail coat and a lot o'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
fixin's, a-actin' like he was a squire; and he had him a
great long beard made out o' corn-silks, and you
wouldn't a-knowed him ef it wasn't fer his voice.
Well, he was a-p'tendin' he was a squire a-tryin' some
kind o' law-suit, you see; and John Wesley he was the
defendunt, and Joney Wiles, I believe it was, played
like he was the plaintive. And they'd had a fallin' out
'bout some land, and was a-lawin' fer p'session, you
understand. Well, Bob he made out it was a mighty
bad case when <i>John-Wes</i> comes to consult him 'bout
it, and tells <i>him</i> ef a little p'int o' law was left out he
thought he could git the land fer him. And then John-Wes
<i>bribes</i> him, you understand, to leave out the p'int
o' law, and the squire says he'll do all he kin, and so
John-Wes goes out a-feelin' purty good. Then <i>Wiles</i>
comes in to consult the squire, don't you see. And the
'squire tells <i>him</i> the same tale he told <i>John Wesley</i>.
So <i>Wiles</i> bribes him to leave out the p'int o' law in <i>his</i>
favor, don't you know. So when the case is tried he
decides in favor o' John-Wes, a-tellin' <i>Wiles</i> some
cock-and-bull story 'bout havin' to manage it thataway
so's to git the case mixed so's he could git it fer him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
shore; and posts <i>him</i> to sue fer change of venue or
somepin',&mdash;anyway, Wiles gits a new trial, and then the
squire decides in <i>his</i> favor, and tells John-Wes another
trial will fix it in <i>his</i> favor, and so on.&mdash;And so it goes
on tel, anyway, he gits holt o' the land hisse'f and all
their money besides, and leaves them to hold the bag!
Well-sir, it was purty well got up; and they said it was
John-Wes's doin's, and I 'low it was&mdash;he was a good
hand at anything o' that sort, and knowed how to make
fun.&mdash;But I've be'n a-tellin' you purty much ever'thing
but what I started out with, and I'll try and hurry
through, 'cause I know you're tired.</p>

<p>'Long 'bout the beginnin' o' summer, things had got
back to purty much the old way. The boys round was
a-gittin' devilish, and o' nights 'specially theyr was a
sight o' meanness a-goin' on. The mill-hands, most of
'em, was mixed up in it&mdash;Coke and Morris, and them 'at
had jined meetin' 'long in the winter had all backslid,
and was a-drinkin' and carousin' round worse'n ever.</p>

<p>People perdicted 'at <i>Bills</i> would backslide, but he
helt on faithful, to all appearance; said he liked to see
a feller when he made up his mind to do right, he liked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
to see him do it, and not go back on his word; and even
went so fer as to tell Ezry ef they didn't putt a stop to
it he'd quit the neighberhood and go somers else. And
Bills was Ezry's head man then, and he couldn't a-got
along 'thout him; and I b'lieve ef Bills had a-said the
word old Ezry would a-turned off ever' hand he had.&mdash;He
got so he jist left ever'thing to Bills. Ben Carter
was turned off fer somepin', and nobody ever knowed
what. Bills and him had never got along jist right
sence the fight.</p>

<p>Ben was with this set I was a-tellin' you 'bout, and
they'd got him to drinkin' and in trouble, o' course. I'd
knowed Ben well enough to know he wouldn't do nothin'
ornry ef he wasn't agged on, and ef he ever was
mixed up in anything o' the kind Wes Morris and John
Coke was at the bottom of it, and I take notice <i>they</i>
wasn't turned off when Ben was.</p>

<p>One night the crowd was out, and Ben amongst 'em,
o' course.&mdash;Sence he'd be'n turned off he'd be'n a-drinkin',&mdash;and
I never blamed him much; he was so good-hearted
like and easy led off, and I allus b'lieved it
wasn't his own doin's.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, this night they cut up awful, and ef they was
one fight they was a dozend; and when all the devilment
was done they <i>could</i> do, they started on a stealin' expedition,
and stold a lot o' chickens and tuk 'em to the mill
to roast 'em; and, to make a long story short, that night
the mill burnt clean to the ground. And the whole pack
of 'em collogued together aginst Carter to saddle it onto
him; claimed 'at they left Ben there at the mill 'bout
twelve o'clock&mdash;which was a fact, fer he was dead drunk
and couldn't git away. Steve stumbled over him while
the mill was a-burnin' and drug him out afore he knowed
what was a-goin' on, and it was all plain enough to Steve
'at Ben didn't have no hand in the firin' of it. But I'll
tell you he sobered up mighty suddent when he seed
what was a-goin' on, and heerd the neighbers a-hollerin',
and a-threatenin' and a-goin' on!&mdash;fer it seemed to
be the ginerl idee 'at the buildin' was fired a-purpose.
And says Ben to Steve, says he, "I expect I'll haf to
say good-bye to you, fer they've got me in a ticklish
place! I kin see through it all now, when it's too
late!" And jist then Wesley Morris hollers out,
"Where's Ben Carter?" and started to'rds where me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
and Ben and Steve was a-standin'; and Ben says, wild-like,
"Don't you two fellers ever think it was <i>my</i>
doin's," and whispers "Good-bye," and started off;
and when we turned, Wesley Morris was a-layin' flat of
his back, and we heerd Carter yell to the crowd 'at
"that man"&mdash;meanin' Morris&mdash;"needed lookin' after
worse than <i>he</i> did," and another minute he plunged
into the river and swum acrost; and we all stood and
watched him in the flickerin' light tel he clum out on
t'other bank; and 'at was the last anybody ever seed o'
Ben Carter!</p>

<p>It must a-be'n about three o'clock in the morning by
this time, and the mill then was jist a-smoulderin' to
ashes&mdash;fer it was as dry as tinder and burnt like a flash&mdash;and
jist as a party was a-talkin' o' organizin' and follerin'
Carter, we heerd a yell 'at I'll never fergit ef I'd
live tell another flood. Old Ezry, it was, as white as a
corpse, and with the blood a-streamin' out of a gash in
his forred, and his clothes half on, come a-rushin' into
the crowd and a-hollerin' fire and murder ever' jump.
"My house is a-burnin', and my folks is all a-bein' murdered
whilse you're a-standin' here! And Bills done it!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Bills done it!" he hollered, as he headed the crowd and
started back fer home. "Bills done it! I caught him at
it; and he would a-murdered me in cold blood ef it
hadn't a-be'n fer his woman. He knocked me down, and
had me tied to a bed-post in the kitchen afore I come to.
And his woman cut me loose and told me to run fer he'p;
and says I, 'Where's Bills?' and she says, 'He's after
<i>me</i> by this time.' And jist then we heerd Bills holler,
and we looked, and he was a-standin' out in the clearin'
in front o' the house, with little Annie in his arms; and
he hollered wouldn't she like to kiss the baby good-bye.
And she hollered My God! fer me to save little Annie,
and fainted clean dead away. And I heerd the roof
a-crackin', and grabbed her up and packed her out jist
in time. And when I looked up, Bills hollered out agin,
and says, 'Ezry,' he says, 'you kin begin to kindo' git
an idee o' what a good feller I am! And ef you hadn't
a-caught me you'd a-never a-knowed it, and "<i>Brother
Williams</i>" wouldn't a-be'n called away to another app'intment
like he is.' And says he, 'Now, ef you foller
me I'll finish you shore!&mdash;You're safe <i>now</i> fer I hain't
got time to waste on you furder.' And jist then his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
woman kindo' come to her senses ag'in and hollered fer
little Annie, and the child heerd her and helt out its
little arms to go to her, and hollered 'Mother! Mother!'
And Bills says, 'Dam yer mother! ef it hadn't a-be'n
fer <i>her</i> I' a-be'n all right. And dam you, too!' he says
to me.&mdash;'This'll pay you fer that lick you struck me;
and fer you a-startin' reports, when I first come, 'at more'n
likely I'd done somepin' mean over East and come out
West to reform! And I wonder ef I <i>didn't</i> do somepin'
mean afore I come here?' he went on; 'kill somebody er
somepin'? And I wonder ef I ain't reformed enough
to go back? Good-bye, Annie!' he hollered; 'and you
needn't fret about yer baby, I'll be the same indulgent
father to it I've allus be'n!' And the baby was a-cryin'
and a-reachin' out its little arms to'rds its mother, when
Bills he turned and struck off in the dark to'rds the river."</p>

<p>This was about the tale 'at Ezry told us, as nigh as I
can rickollect: and by the time he finished, I never want
to see jist sich another crowd o' men as was a-swarmin'
there. Ain't it awful when sich a crowd gits together?
I tell you it makes my flesh creep to think about it!</p>

<p>As Bills had gone in the direction of the river, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
wasn't long in makin' our minds up 'at he'd haf to cross
it, and ef he done <i>that</i> he'd haf to use the boat 'at was
down below the mill, er wade it at the ford, a mil'd er
more down. So we divided in three sections, like&mdash;one
to go and look after the folks at the house, and another
to the boat, and another to the ford. And Steve and
me and Ezry was in the crowd 'at struck fer the boat:
and we made time a-gittin' there! It was awful dark,
and the sky was a-cloudin' up, like a storm; but we wasn't
long a-gittin' to the p'int where the boat was allus tied;
but they wasn't no boat there! Steve kindo' tuk the
lead, and we all talked in whispers. And Steve said to
kindo' lay low and maybe we could hear somepin'; and
some feller said he thought he heerd somepin' strange-like,
but the wind was kindo' raisin' and kep' up sich a
moanin' through the trees along the bank 'at we couldn't
make out nothin'. "Listen!" says Steve, suddent-like,
"<i>I</i> hear somepin'!" We was all still ag'in&mdash;and we all
heerd a moanin' 'at was sadder'n the wind&mdash;sounded
mournfuller to <i>me</i>,&mdash;'cause I knowed it in a minute, and I
whispered, "Little Annie." And 'way out acrost the
river we could hear the little thing a-sobbin', and we all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
was still's death; and we heerd a voice we knowed was
Bills's say, "Dam ye! Keep still, or I'll drownd ye!"
And the wind kindo' moaned ag'in, and we could hear
the trees a-screetchin' together in the dark, and the
leaves a-rustlin'; and when it kindo' lulled ag'in, we
heerd Bills make a kindo' splash with the oars; and jist
then Steve whispered fer to lay low and be ready&mdash;he
was a-goin' to riconn'itre; and he took his coat and
shoes off, and slid over the bank and down into the
worter as slik as a' eel. Then ever'thing was still
ag'in, 'cept the moanin' o' the child, which kep' a-gittin'
louder and louder; and then a voice whispered to
us, "He's a-comin' back; the crowd below has sent
scouts up, and they're on t'other side. Now watch
clos't, and he's our meat." We could hear Bills, by
the moanin' o' the baby, a-comin' nearder and nearder,
tel suddently he made a sorto' miss-lick with the oar, I
reckon, and must a-splashed the baby, fer she set up a
loud cryin'; and jist then old Ezry, who was a-leanin'
over the bank, kindo' lost his grip, some way o' nother,
and fell kersplash in the worter like a' old chunk.
"Hello?" says Bills, through the dark, "you're there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
too, air ye?" as old Ezry splashed up the bank ag'in.
And "Cuss you!" he says then, to the baby&mdash;"ef it
hadn't be'n fer <i>your</i> infernal squawkin' I'd a-be'n all
right; but you've brought the whole neighberhood out,
and, dam you, I'll jist let you swim out to 'em!" And
we heerd a splash, then a kindo gurglin', and then
Steve's voice a-hollerin', "Close in on him, boys; I've
got the baby!" And about a dozent of us bobbed off
the bank like so many bull-frogs, and I'll tell you the
worter b'iled! We could jist make out the shape o'
the boat, and Bills a-standin' with a' oar drawed back to
smash the first head 'at come in range. It was a mean
place to git at him. We knowed he was despert, and
fer a minute we kindo' helt back. Fifteen foot o'
worter's a mighty onhandy place to git hit over the
head in! And Bills says, "You hain't afeard, I rickon&mdash;twenty
men ag'in one!" "You'd better give yourse'f
up!" hollered Ezry from the shore. "No, Brother
Sturgiss," says Bills, "I can't say 'at I'm at all anxious
'bout bein' borned ag'in, jist yit awhile," he says; "I
see you kindo' 'pear to go in fer baptism; guess you'd
better go home and git some dry clothes on; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
speakin' o' home, you'd ort 'o be there by all means&mdash;your
house might catch afire and burn up whilse you're
gone!" And jist then the boat give a suddent shove
under him&mdash;some feller'd div under and tilted it&mdash;and
fer a minute it throwed him off his guard, and the boys
closed in. Still he had the advantage, bein' in the boat:
and as fast as a feller would climb in he'd git a whack
o' the oar, tell finally they got to pilin' in a little too
fast fer him to manage, and he hollered then at we'd
have to come to the bottom ef we got him, and with
that he div out o' the end o' the boat, and we lost sight
of him; and I'll be blame ef he didn't give us the slip
after all!</p>

<p>Wellsir, we watched fer him, and some o' the boys
swum on down stream, expectin' he'd raise, but couldn't
find hide ner hair of him; so we left the boat a-driftin'
off down stream and swum ashore, a-thinkin' he'd jist
drownded hisse'f a-purpose. But they was more su'prise
waitin' fer us yit,&mdash;fer lo-and-behold-ye, when we
got ashore they wasn't no trace o' Steve er the baby to
be found. Ezry said he seed Steve when he fetched
little Annie ashore, and she was all right, on'y she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
purt-nigh past cryin'; and he said Steve had lapped his
coat around her and give her to him to take charge of,
and he got so excited over the fight he laid her down
betwixt a couple o' logs and kindo' fergot about her tel
the thing was over, and he went to look fer her, and she
was gone. Couldn't a-be'n 'at she'd a-wundered off
her-own-se'f; and it couldn't a-be'n 'at <i>Steve</i>'d take
her, 'thout a-lettin' us know it. It was a mighty aggervatin'
conclusion to come to, but we had to do it,
and that was, <i>Bills</i> must a-got ashore unbeknownst to
us and packed her off. Sich a thing wasn't hardly
probable, yit it was a thing 'at <i>might</i> be; and after
a-talkin' it over we had to admit 'at <i>that</i> must a-be'n
the way of it. But where was <i>Steve</i>? W'y, we argied,
he'd diskivvered she was gone, and had putt out on
track of her 'thout losin' time to stop and explain the
thing. The next question was, what did Bills want
with her ag'in?&mdash;He'd tried to drownd her onc't. We
could ast questions enough, but c'rect answers was
mighty skearce, and we jist concluded 'at the best thing
to do was to putt out fer the ford, fer that was the nighdest
place Bills could cross 'thout a boat, and ef it <i>was</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
him tuk the child, he was still on our side o' the river,
o' course. So we struck out fer the ford, a-leavin'
a couple o' men to search <i>up</i> the river. A drizzlin'
sorto' rain had set in by this time, and with that and
the darkness and the moanin' of the wind, it made 'bout
as lonesome a prospect as a feller ever wants to go
through ag'in.</p>

<p>It was jist a-gittin' a little gray-like in the morning by
the time we reached the ford, but you couldn't hardly
see two rods afore you fer the mist and the fog 'at had
settled along the river. We looked fer tracks, but
couldn't make out nothin'. Thereckly old Ezry punched
me and p'inted out acrost the river. "What's that?"
he whispers. Jist 'bout half-way acrost was somepin'
white-like in the worter&mdash;couldn't make out what&mdash;perfeckly
still it was. And I whispered back and told him
I guess it wasn't nothin' but a sycamore snag. "Listen!"
says he; "sycamore snags don't make no noise like that!"
And, shore enough, it was the same moanin' noise we'd
heerd the baby makin' when we first got on the track.
Sobbin' she was, as though nigh about dead. "Well, ef
that's <i>Bills</i>," says I&mdash;"and I reckon they hain't no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
doubt but it is&mdash;what in the name o' all that's good and
bad's the feller a-standin' there fer!" And a-creepin'
clos'ter, we could make him out plainer and plainer. It
<i>was</i> him; and there he stood breast-high in the worter,
a-holdin' the baby on his shoulder like, and a-lookin' up
stream, and a-waitin.'</p>

<p>"What do you make out of it?" says Ezry. "What's
he waitin' fer?"</p>

<p>And, a-strainin' my eyes in the direction <i>he</i> was
a-lookin', I seed somepin' a-movin' down the river, and
a minute later I'd made out the old boat a-driftin' down
stream; and then of course ever'thing was plain enough:
He was waitin' fer the boat, and ef he got <i>that</i> he'd
have the same advantage on us he had afore.</p>

<p>"Boys," says I, "he mustn't git that boat ag'in!
Foller me, and don't let him git to the shore alive!"
And in we plunged. He seed us, but he never budged,
on'y to grab the baby by its little legs, and swing it out
at arms-len'th. "Stop, there!" he hollered.&mdash;"Stop
jist where ye air! Move another inch and I'll drownd
this dam young-un afore yer eyes!" he says.&mdash;And he'd
a-done it. "Boys," says I, "he's got us. Don't move!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
This thing'll have to rest with a higher power'n our'n!
Ef any of you kin <i>pray</i>," says I, "now's a good time to
do it!"</p>

<p>Jist then the boat swung up, and Bills grabbed it and
retch 'round and set the baby in it, never a-takin' his eye
off o' us, though, fer a minute. "Now," says he, with a
sorto' snarlin' laugh, "I've on'y got a little while to stay
with you, and I want to say a few words afore I go. I
want to tell you fellers, in the first place, 'at you've be'n
<i>fooled</i> in me: I <i>hain't</i> a good feller&mdash;now, honest! And
ef you're a little the worse fer findin' it out so late in the
day, you hain't none the worse fer losin' me so soon&mdash;fer
I'm a-goin' away now, and any interference with my
arrangements'll on'y give you more trouble; so it's better
all around to let me go peaceable and jist while I'm in
the notion. I expect it'll be a disapp'intment to some o'
you that my name hain't 'Williams,' but it hain't. And
maybe you won't think nigh as much o' me when I tell
you furder 'at I was obleeged to 'dopt the name o' 'Williams'
onc't to keep from bein' strung up to a lamp-post,
but sich is the facts. I was so extremely unfortunit
onc't as to kill a p'tickler friend o' mine, and he forgive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
me with his dyin' breath, and told me to run whilse I
could, and be a better man. But he'd spotted me with
a' ugly mark 'at made it kindo' onhandy <i>to</i> git away, but
I did at last; and jist as I was a-gittin' reformed-like, you
fellers had to kick in the traces, and I've made up my
mind to hunt out a more moraler community, where
they don't make sich a fuss about trifles. And havin'
nothin' more to say, on'y to send <i>Annie</i> word 'at I'll still
be a father to her young-un here, I'll bid you all good-bye."
And with that he turned and clum in the boat&mdash;or
ruther <i>fell</i> in,&mdash;fer somepin' black-like had riz up in
it, with a' awful lick&mdash;my&mdash;God!&mdash;And, a minute later,
boat and baggage was a-gratin' on the shore, and a
crowd come thrashin' 'crost from t'other side to jine us,&mdash;and
'peared like wasn't a <i>second</i> longer tel a feller was
a-swingin' by his neck to the limb of a scrub-oak, his
feet clean off the ground and his legs a-jerkin' up and
down like a limber-jack's.</p>

<p>And Steve it was a-layin' in the boat, and he'd rid a
mil'd er more 'thout knowin' of it. Bills had struck and
stunt him as he clum in whilse the rumpus was a-goin'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
on, and he'd on'y come to in time to hear Bills's farewell
address to us there at the ford.</p>

<p>Steve tuk charge o' little Annie ag'in, and ef she'd
a-be'n his own child he wouldn't a-went on more over her
than he did; and said nobody but her mother would git
her out o' his hands ag'in. And he was as good as his
word; and ef you could a-seed him a half hour after
that, when he <i>did</i> give her to her mother&mdash;all lapped up
in his coat and as drippin' wet as a little drownded
angel&mdash;it would a-made you wish't you was him to see
that little woman a-caperin' round him, and a-thankin'
him, and a-cryin' and a-laughin', and almost a-huggin'
him, she was so tickled,&mdash;well, I thought in my soul
she'd die! And Steve blushed like a girl to see her
a-takin' on, and a-thankin' him, and a-cryin', and a-kissin'
little Annie, and a-goin' on. And when she inquired
'bout Bills, which she did all suddent-like, with a burst
o' tears, we jist didn't have the heart to tell her&mdash;on'y
we said he'd crossed the river and got away. And he
had!</p>

<p>And now comes a part o' this thing 'at'll more'n like
tax you to believe it: Williams and her wasn't man and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
wife&mdash;and you needn't look su'prised, nuther, and I'll
tell you fer why:&mdash;They was own brother and sister; and
that brings me to <i>her</i> part of the story, which you'll haf
to admit beats anything 'at you ever read about in books.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />

<p>Her and Williams&mdash;that <i>wasn't</i> his name, like he acknowledged,
hisse'f, you rickollect&mdash;ner <i>she</i> didn't want
to tell his right name; and we forgive her fer that. Her
and "Williams" was own brother and sister, and their
parunts lived in Ohio some'ers. Their mother had be'n
dead five year' and better&mdash;grieved to death over her
onnachurl brother's recklessness, which Annie hinted
had broke her father up in some way, in tryin' to shield
him from the law. And the secret of her bein' with him
was this: She had married a man o' the name of Curtis
or Custer, I don't mind which, adzackly&mdash;but no matter;
she'd married a well-to-do young feller 'at her
brother helt a' old grudge ag'in, she never knowed what;
and, sence her marriage, her brother had went on from
bad to worse, tel finally her father jist give him up and
told him to go it his own way&mdash;he'd killed his <i>mother</i>
and ruined <i>him</i>, and he'd jist give up all hopes! But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Annie&mdash;you know how a sister is&mdash;she still clung to him
and done ever'thing fer him, tel finally, one night, about
three years after she was married, she got word some
way that he was in trouble ag'in, and sent her husband
to he'p him; and a half hour after he'd gone, her
brother come in, all excited and bloody, and told her to
git the baby and come with him, 'at her husband had got
in a quarrel with a friend o' his and was bad hurt. And
she went with him, of course, and he tuk her in a buggy,
and lit out with her as tight as he could go all
night; and then told her 'at <i>he</i> was the feller 'at had
quarrelled with her husband, and the officers was after
him, and he was obleeged to leave the country, and fer
fear he hadn't made shore work o' him, he was a-takin'
her along to make shore of his gittin' his revenge; and
he swore he'd kill her and the baby too ef she dared to
whimper. And so it was, through a hunderd hardships
he'd made his way at last to our section o' the country,
givin' out 'at they was man and wife, and keepin' her
from denyin' of it by threats, and promises of the time
a-comin' when he'd send her home to her man ag'in in
case he hadn't killed him. And so it run on tel you'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
a-cried to hear her tell it, and still see her sister's love
fer the feller a-breakin' out by a-declarin' how kind he
was to her <i>at times</i>, and how he wasn't railly bad at
heart, on'y fer his ungov'nable temper. But I couldn't
he'p but notice, when she was a-tellin' of her hist'ry,
what a quiet sorto' look o' satisfaction settled on the
face o' Steve and the rest of 'em, don't you understand.</p>

<p>And now they was on'y one thing she wanted to ast,
she said; and that was,&mdash;could she still make her home
with us tel she could git word to her friends?&mdash;and
there she broke down ag'in, not knowin', of course,
whether <i>they</i> was dead er alive; fer time and time ag'in
she said somepin' told her she'd never see her husband
ag'in on this airth; and then the women-folks would cry
with her and console her, and the boys would speak
hopeful&mdash;all but Steve; some way o' nother Steve was
never like hisse'f from that time on.</p>

<p>And so things went fer a month and better. Ever'thing
had quieted down, and Ezry and a lot o' hands,
and me and Steve amongst 'em, was a-workin' on the
frame-work of another mill. It was purty weather, and
we was all in good sperits, and it 'peared like the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
neighberhood inte<i>rest</i>ed&mdash;and they <i>was</i>, too&mdash;women-folks
and ever'body. And that day Ezry's woman and
amongst 'em was a-gittin' up a big dinner to fetch down
to us from the house; and along about noon a spruce-lookin'
young feller, with a pale face and a black beard,
like, come a-ridin' by and hitched his hoss, and comin'
into the crowd, said "Howdy," pleasant-like, and we
all stopped work as he went on to say 'at he was on the
track of a feller o' the name o' "Williams," and wanted
to know ef we could give him any infermation 'bout
sich a man. Told him maybe,&mdash;'at a feller bearin'
that name desappeared kindo' myster'ous from our
neighberhood 'bout five weeks afore that. "My God!"
says he a-turnin' paler'n ever, "am I too late? Where
did he go, and was his sister and her baby with him?"
Jist then I ketched sight o' the women-folks a-comin'
with the baskets, and Annie with 'em, with a jug o'
worter in her hand; so I spoke up quick to the stranger,
and says I, "I guess 'his sister and her baby' wasn't
along," says I, "but his <i>wife</i> and <i>baby's</i> some'eres here
in the neighberhood yit." And then a-watchin' him
clos't, I says suddent, a-p'intin' over his shoulder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
"There his woman is now&mdash;that one with the jug,
there." Well, Annie had jist stooped to lift up one o'
the little girls, when the feller turned, and their eyes
met. "Annie! My wife!" he says; and Annie she
kindo' give a little yelp like and come a-flutterin' down
in his arms; and the jug o' worter rolled clean acrost
the road, and turned a somerset and knocked the cob
out of its mouth and jist laid back and hollered "Good&mdash;good&mdash;good&mdash;good&mdash;good!"
like as ef it knowed
what was up and was jist as glad and tickled as the rest
of us.</p>

<h2>DIALECT IN LITERATURE</h2>

<p>"<i>And the common people heard him gladly.</i>"</p>


<p>Of what shall be said herein of dialect, let it be understood
the term dialect referred to is of that general
breadth of meaning given it to-day, namely, any speech
or vernacular outside the prescribed form of good English
in its present state. The present state of the
English is, of course, not any one of its prior states.
So first let it be remarked that it is highly probable that
what may have been the best of English once may now
by some be counted as a weak, inconsequent <i>patois</i>, or
dialect.</p>

<p>To be direct, it is the object of this article to show
that dialect is not a thing to be despised in any event&mdash;that
its origin is oftentimes of as royal caste as that of
any speech. Listening back, from the standpoint of to-day,
even to the divine singing of that old classic master
to whom England's late laureate refers as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"... the first warbler, whose sweet breath<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Preluded those melodious bursts that fill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spacious times of great Elizabeth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With sounds that echo still";<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or to whom Longfellow alludes, in his matchless sonnet, as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"... the poet of the dawn, who wrote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Canterbury Tales, and his old age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made beautiful with song";&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Chaucer's verse to us is <i>now</i> as veritably dialect as to
that old time it <i>was</i> the chastest English; and even then
his materials were essentially dialect when his song was
at best pitch. Again, our present dialect, of most
plebeian ancestry, may none the less prove worthy.
Mark the recognition of its own personal merit in the
great new dictionary, where what was, in our own remembrance,
the most outlandish dialect, is now good,
sound, official English.</p>

<hr style="width: 35%;" />

<p>Since Literature must embrace all naturally existing
materials&mdash;physical, mental, and spiritual&mdash;we have no
occasion to urge its acceptance of so-called dialect, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
dialect <i>is</i> in Literature, and <i>has</i> been there since the beginning
of all written thought and utterance. Strictly
speaking, as well as paradoxically, all verbal expression
is more or less dialectic, however grammatical. While
usage establishes grammar, it no less establishes so-called
dialect. Therefore we may as rightfully refer to
"so-called grammar."</p>

<p>It is not really a question of Literature's position
toward dialect that we are called upon to consider, but
rather how much of Literature's valuable time shall be
taken up by this dialectic country cousin. This question
Literature her gracious self most amiably answers by
hugging to her breast voluminous tomes, from Chaucer
on to Dickens, from Dickens on to Joel Chandler Harris.
And this affectionate spirit on the part of Literature, in
the main, we all most feelingly indorse.</p>

<p>Briefly summed, it would appear that dialect means
something more than mere rude form of speech and
action&mdash;that it must, in some righteous and substantial
way, convey to us a positive force of soul, truth, dignity,
beauty, grace, purity and sweetness that may even touch
us to the tenderness of tears. Yes, dialect as certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
does all this as that speech and act refined may do it,
and for the same reason: it is simply, purely natural
and human.</p>

<p>Yet the Lettered and the Unlettered powers are at
swords' points; and very old and bitter foemen, too,
they are. As fairly as we can, then, let us look over
the field of these contending forces and note their diverse
positions: First, <i>the Lettered</i>&mdash;they who have
the full advantages of refined education, training, and
association&mdash;are undoubtedly as wholly out of order
among <i>the Unlettered</i> as the Unlettered are out of order
in the exalted presence of the Lettered. Each faction
may in like aversion ignore or snub the other; but a
long-suffering Providence must bear with the society of
both. There may be one vague virtue demonstrated by
this feud: each division will be found unwaveringly
loyal to its kind, and mutually they desire no interchange
of sympathy whatever.&mdash;Neither element will
accept from the other any <i>patronizing</i> treatment; and,
perhaps, the more especially does the <i>Unlettered</i> faction
reject anything in vaguest likeness of this spirit. Of
the two divisions, in graphic summary,&mdash;<i>one</i> knows the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
very core and centre of refined civilization, and this
only; the <i>other</i> knows the outlying wilds and suburbs
of civilization, and this only. Whose, therefore, is the
greater knowledge, and whose the just right of any whit
of self-glorification?</p>

<p>A curious thing, indeed, is this factional pride, as
made equally manifest in both forces; in one, for instance,
of the Unlettered forces: The average farmer,
or countryman, knows, in reality, a far better and wider
range of diction than he permits himself to use. He restricts
and abridges the vocabulary of his speech, fundamentally,
for the reason that he fears offending his rural
<i>neighbors</i>, to whom a choicer speech might suggest, on
his part, an assumption&mdash;a spirit of conscious superiority,
and therewith an implied reflection on <i>their</i> lack of
intelligence and general worthiness. If there is any one
text universally known and nurtured of the Unlettered
masses of our common country, it is that which reads,
"All men are created equal." Therefore it is a becoming
thing when true gentility prefers to overlook some
variations of the class who, more from lack of cultivation
than out of rude intent, sometimes almost compel a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
positive doubt of the nice veracity of the declaration, or
at least a grief at the munificent liberality of the so-be-quoted
statement. The somewhat bewildering position
of these conflicting forces leaves us nothing further to
consider, but how to make the most and best of the situation
so far as Literature may be hurt or helped
thereby.</p>

<p>Equally with the perfect English, then, dialect should
have full justice done it. Then always it is worthy, and
in Literature is thus welcome. The writer of dialect
should as reverently venture in its use as in his chastest
English. His effort in the <i>scholarly</i> and <i>elegant</i> direction
suffers no neglect&mdash;he is <i>schooled</i> in that, perhaps,
he may explain. Then let him be <i>schooled</i> in <i>dialect</i>
before he sets up as an expounder of it&mdash;a teacher, forsooth
a master! The real master must not only know
each varying light and shade of dialect expression, but
he must as minutely know the inner character of the
people whose native tongue it is, else his product is
simply a pretence&mdash;a wilful forgery, a rank abomination.
Dialect has been and is thus insulted, vilified,
and degraded, now and continually; and through this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
outrage solely, thousands of generous-minded readers
have been turned against dialect who otherwise would
have loved and blessed it in its real form of crude purity
and unstrained sweetness&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Honey dripping from the comb!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Let no impious faddist, then, assume its just interpretation.
He may know everything else in the world, but
not dialect, nor dialectic people, for both of which he
has supreme contempt, which same, be sure, is heartily
returned. Such a "superior" personage may even go
among these simple country people and abide indefinitely
in the midst of them, yet their more righteous contempt
never for one instant permits them to be their real selves
in his presence. In consequence, his most conscientious
report of them, their ways, lives, and interests, is absolutely
of no importance or value in the world. He never
knew them, nor will he ever know them. They are not
his kind of people, any more than he is their kind of
man; and <i>their</i> disappointment grieves us more than his.</p>

<p>The master in Literature, as in any art, is that "divinely
gifted man" who does just obeisance to all living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
creatures, "both man and beast and bird." It is this
master only who, as he writes, can sweep himself aside
and leave his humble characters to do the thinking and
the talking. This man it is who celebrates his performance&mdash;not
himself. His work he celebrates because it
is not his only, but because he feels it the conscientious
reproduction of the life itself&mdash;as he has seen and known
and felt it;&mdash;a representation it is of God's own script,
translated and transcribed by the worshipful mind and
heart and hand of genius. This virtue in all art is impartially
demanded, and genius only can fully answer
the demand in any art for which we claim perfection.
The painter has his expression of it, with no slighting
of the dialectic element; so, too, the sculptor, the musician,
and the list entire. In the line of Literature and
literary material, an illustration of the nice meaning and
distinction of dialectic art will be found in Charles Dudley
Warner's comment of George Cable's work, as far
back as 1883, referring to the author's own rendition of
it from the platform. Mr. Warner says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>While the author was unfolding to his audience a life and
society unfamiliar to them and entrancing them with pictures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
the reality of which none doubted and the spell of which none
cared to escape, it occurred to me that here was the solution of
all the pother we have recently got into about the realistic and
the ideal schools in fiction. In "Posson Jone," an awkward
camp-meeting country preacher is the victim of a vulgar confidence
game; the scenes are the street, a drinking-place, a
gambling-saloon, a bull-ring, and a calaboose; there is not a
"respectable" character in it. Where shall we look for a more
faithful picture of low life? Where shall we find another so
vividly set forth in all its sordid details? And yet see how art
steps in, with the wand of genius, to make literature! Over the
whole the author has cast an ideal light; over a picture that, in
the hands of a bungling realist, would have been repellant he
has thrown the idealizing grace that makes it one of the most
charming sketches in the world. Here is nature, as nature only
ought to be in literature, elevated but never departed from.</p></div>

<p>So we find dialect, as a branch of Literature, worthy
of the high attention and employment of the greatest
master in letters&mdash;not the merest mountebank. Turn to
Dickens, in innumerable passages of pathos: the death
of poor Jo, or that of the "Cheap John's" little daughter
in her father's arms, on the foot-board of his peddling
cart before the jeering of the vulgar mob; smile moistly,
too, at Mr. Sleary's odd philosophies; or at the trials of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
Sissy Jupe; or lift and tower with indignation, giving
ear to Stephen Blackpool and the stainless nobility of
his cloyed utterances.</p>

<p>The crudeness or the homeliness of the dialectic element
does not argue its unfitness in any way. Some
readers seem to think so; but they are wrong, and very
gravely wrong. Our own brief history as a nation, and our
finding and founding and maintaining of it, left our forefathers
little time indeed for the delicate cultivation of
the arts and graces of refined and scholarly attainments.
And there is little wonder, and great blamelessness on
their part, if they lapsed in point of high mental accomplishments,
seeing their attention was so absorbed
by propositions looking toward the protection of their
rude farm-homes, their meagre harvests, and their half-stabled
cattle from the dread invasion of the Indian.
Then, too, they had their mothers and their wives and
little ones to protect, to clothe, to feed, and to die for
in this awful line of duty, as hundreds upon hundreds
did. These sad facts are here accented and detailed not
so much for the sake of being tedious as to more clearly
indicate why it was that many of the truly heroic ancestry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
of "our best people" grew unquestionably dialect
of caste&mdash;not alone in speech, but in every mental trait
and personal address. It is a grievous fact for us to
confront, but many of them wore apparel of the commonest,
talked loudly, and doubtless said "thisaway"
and "thataway," and "Watch y' doin' of?" and "Whur
y' goin' at?"&mdash;using dialect even in their prayers to Him
who, in His gentle mercy, listened and was pleased; and
who listens verily unto this hour to all like prayers, and
yet pleased; yea, haply listens even to the refined rhetorical
petitions of those who are <i>not</i> pleased.</p>

<p>There is something more at fault than the language
when we turn from or flinch at it; and, as has been intimated,
the wretched fault may be skulkingly hidden
away in the ambush of <i>ostensible</i> dialect&mdash;that type of
dialect so copiously produced by its sole manufacturers,
who, utterly stark and bare of the vaguest idea of
country life or country people, at once assume that all
their "gifted pens" have to do is to stupidly misspell
every word; vulgarly mistreat and besloven every theme,
however sacred; maim, cripple, and disfigure language
never in the vocabulary of the countryman&mdash;then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
smuggle these monstrosities of either rhyme or prose
somehow into the public print that is to innocently
smear them broadcast all over the face of the country
they insult.</p>

<p>How different the mind and method of the true interpreter.
As this phrase goes down the man himself
arises&mdash;the type perfect&mdash;Colonel Richard Malcolm
Johnston, who wrote "The Dukesborough Tales"&mdash;an
accomplished classic scholar and teacher, yet no less an
accomplished master and lover of his native dialect of
middle Georgia. He, like Dickens, permits his rustic
characters to think, talk, act, and live, just as nature
designed them. He does not make the pitiable error of
either patronizing or making fun of them. He knows
them and he loves them; and they know and love him in
return. Recalling Colonel Johnston's dialectic sketches,
with his own presentation of them from the platform,
the writer notes a fact that seems singularly to obtain
among all true dialect-writers, namely, that they are
also endowed with native histrionic capabilities: <i>Hear</i>,
as well as read, Twain, Cable, Johnston, Page, Smith,
and all the list, with barely an exception.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>Did space permit, no better illustration of true dialect
sketch and characterization might here be offered than
Colonel Johnston's simple story of "Mr. Absalom Billingslea,"
or the short and simple annals of his like
quaint contemporaries, "Mr. Bill Williams" and "Mr.
Jonas Lively." The scene is the country and the very
little country town, with landscape, atmosphere, simplicity,
circumstance&mdash;all surroundings and conditions&mdash;<i>veritable</i>&mdash;everything
rural and dialectic, no less than
the simple, primitive, common, wholesome-hearted men
and women who so naturally live and have their blessed
being in his stories, just as in the life itself. This is the
manifest work of the true dialect writer and expounder.
In every detail, the most minute, such work reveals the
master-hand and heart of the humanitarian as well as
artist&mdash;the two are indissolubly fused&mdash;and the result of
such just treatment of whatever lowly themes or characters
we can but love and loyally approve with all our
human hearts. Such masters necessarily are rare, and
such ripe perfecting as is here attained may be in part
the mellowing result of age and long observation, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
it can but be based upon the wisest, purest spirit of the
man as well as artist.</p>

<p>In no less excellence should the work of Joel Chandler
Harris be regarded: His touch alike is ever reverential.
He has gathered up the bruised and broken voices and
the legends of the slave, and from his child-heart he
has affectionately yielded them to us in all their eerie
beauty and wild loveliness. Through them we are made
to glorify the helpless and the weak and to revel in their
victories. But, better, we are taught that even in barbaric
breasts there dwells inherently the sense of right
above wrong&mdash;equity above law&mdash;and the One Unerring
Righteousness Eternal. With equal truth and strength,
too, Mr. Harris has treated the dialectic elements of the
interior Georgia country&mdash;the wilds and fastnesses of
the "moonshiners." His tale of "Teague Poteet," of
some years ago, was contemporaneous with the list of
striking mountain stories from that strong and highly
gifted Tennesseean, Miss Murfree, or "Charles Egbert
Craddock." In the dialectic spirit her stories charm and
hold us. Always there is strangely mingled, but most
naturally, the gentle nature cropping out amid the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
desperate and stoical: the night scene in the isolated
mountain cabin, guarded ever without and within from
any chance down-swooping of the minions of the red-eyed
law; the great man-group of gentle giants, with
rifles never out of arm's-reach, in tender rivalry ranged
admiringly around the crowing, wakeful little boy-baby;
the return, at last, of the belated mistress of the
house&mdash;the sister, to whom all do great, awkward reverence.
Jealously snatching up the babe and kissing it,
she querulously demands why he has not long ago been
put to bed. "He 'lowed he wouldn't go," is the reply.</p>

<p>Thomas Nelson Page, of Virginia, who wrote "Meh
Lady"&mdash;a positive classic in the Negro dialect: his
work is veritable&mdash;strong and pure and sweet; and as an
oral reader of it the doubly gifted author, in voice and
cadence, natural utterance, every possible effect of
speech and tone, is doubtless without rival anywhere.</p>

<p>Many more, indeed, than may be mentioned now
there are of these real benefactors and preservers of the
wayside characters, times, and customs of our ever-shifting
history. Needless is it to speak here of the earlier
of our workers in the dialectic line&mdash;of James Russell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Lowell's New England "Hosea Biglow," Dr. Eggleston's
"Hoosier School-Master," or the very rare and
quaint, bright prattle of "Helen's Babies." In connection
with this last let us very seriously inquire what this
<i>real</i> child has done that Literature should so persistently
refuse to give him an abiding welcome? Since for ages
this question seems to have been left unasked, it may be
timely now to propound it. Why not the real child in
Literature? The real child is good enough (we all
know he is bad enough) to command our admiring attention
and most lively interest in real life, and just as
we find him "in the raw." Then why do we deny him
any righteous place of recognition in our Literature?
From the immemorial advent of our dear old Mother
Goose, Literature has been especially catering to the
juvenile needs and desires, and yet steadfastly overlooking,
all the time, the very principles upon which Nature
herself founds and presents this lawless little brood of
hers&mdash;the children. It is not the children who are out
of order; it is Literature. And not only is Literature
out of order, but she is presumptuous; she is impudent.
She takes Nature's children and revises and corrects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
them till "their own mother doesn't know them." This
is literal fact. So, very many of us are coming to inquire,
as we've a right, why is the real child excluded
from a just hearing in the world of letters as he has in
the world of fact? For instance, what has the lovely
little ragamuffin ever done of sufficient guilt to eternally
consign him to the monstrous penalty of speaking most
accurate grammar all the literary hours of the days of
the years of his otherwise natural life?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, mother, may I go to school<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With brother Charles to-day?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The air is very fine and cool;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh, mother, say I may!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;Is this a real boy that would make such a request,
and is it the real language he would use? No, we are
glad to say that it is not. Simply it is a libel, in every
particular, on any boy, however fondly and exactingly
trained by parents however zealous for his overdecorous
future. Better, indeed, the dubious sentiment of the
most trivial nursery jingle, since the latter at least maintains
the lawless though wholesome spirit of the child-genuine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hink! Minx! The old witch winks&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The fat begins to fry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's nobody home but Jumping Joan,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Father and mother and I."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Though even here the impious poet leaves the scar of
grammatical knowledge upon childhood's native diction;
and so the helpless little fellow is again misrepresented,
and his character, to all intents and purposes, is assaulted
and maligned outrageously thereby.</p>

<p>Now, in all seriousness, this situation ought not to be
permitted to exist, though to change it seems an almost
insurmountable task. The general public, very probably,
is not aware of the real gravity of the position of
the case as even unto this day it exists. Let the public
try, then, to contribute the real child to the so-called
Child Literature of its country, and have its real child
returned as promptly as it dare show its little tousled
head in the presence of that scholarly and dignified institution.
Then ask why your real child has been
spanked back home again, and the wise mentors there
will virtually tell you that Child Literature wants no
real children in it, that the real child's example of defective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
grammar and lack of elegant deportment would
furnish to its little patrician patrons suggestions very
hurtful indeed to their higher morals, tendencies, and
ambitions. Then, although the general public couldn't
for the life of it see why or how, and might even be
reminded that <i>it</i> was just such a rowdying child itself,
and that its <i>father</i>&mdash;the Father of his Country&mdash;was just
such a child; that Abraham Lincoln was just such a
lovable, lawless child, and yet was blessed and chosen in
the end for the highest service man may ever render
unto man,&mdash;all&mdash;all this argument would avail not in
the least, since the elegantly minded purveyors of Child
Literature can not possibly tolerate the presence of any
but the refined children&mdash;the very proper children&mdash;the
studiously thoughtful, poetic children;&mdash;and these must
be kept safe from the contaminating touch of our rough-and-tumble
little fellows in "hodden gray," with frowzly
heads, begrimed but laughing faces, and such awful,
awful vulgarities of naturalness, and crimes of simplicity,
and brazen faith and trust, and love of life and
everybody in it. All other real people are getting into
Literature; and without some real children along will
they not soon be getting lonesome, too?</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
